		<h1>Wireframes</h1>
		<p> Wireframes are a barebones representation of a product’s visual interface. They focus on functionality, content, and behaviors and therefore typically lack color, graphics or text styling. The primary purpose of a wireframe is to communicate information architecture to stakeholders, designers, and developers and to encourage ideation. Wireframes can describe features and functions, page navigation, layout, and interactivity in the form geometric shapes, placeholder text, and images. Whether low or high fidelity, wireframes are an artifact to stimulate discussion and “What-if” thinking.</p>
