		<h1>Storyboards</h1>
		<p> Storyboards, a technique borrowed from cartooning and movie-making, are a sequence of low-fidelity images used to illustrate a task using images to tell a story, allows the designer to convey events and flow with a limited number of words. In addition, the storyboard integrates the product’s user interface into a real life experience and places focus on the user’s behavior and how they successfully achieved their goal with a minimum effort. Storyboards are especially useful as an input for User Scenarios and Journey Maps. A storyboard depicting a persona performing a task is an excellent way to determine the optimal performance of that task and whether the task has value to the persona.</p>
