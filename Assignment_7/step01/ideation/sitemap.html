		<h1>Site Map Diagram</h1>
		<p> A Site Map Diagram, also known simply as a “site map,” is a visual representation of a product’s hierarchy and its page flows. They can be created for a new site or application based on the results of a Task Analysis. For the purposes of this article, however, we will examine the creation of a diagram for an existing product. Information Architects creating Site Map Diagrams typically use flowchart software like Visio, Gliffy, or OmniGraffle. This method concisely illustrates a product’s scope, relationships between pages, and inconsistencies between navigation and content labels. It can also bring attention to the presence of orphan pages or extraneous content.</p>
