		<p> Affinity Diagramming is a type of card sorting activity for your product team to engage in. You can use Affinity Diagramming any time you are dealing with a large amount of information that needs culling, sorting, or classification but doesnâ€™t require the input of test users, for example: During stakeholder meetings, to better understand opportunities; after contextual interviews, to organize your notes; in UX workshops, to have participants categorize information; during product planning, to gain consensus on requirements and strategy.</p>
