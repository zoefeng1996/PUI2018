		<h1>Rapid Prototyping</h1>
		<p>Rapid Prototyping is a method of (usually) low-fidelity prototyping that allows for multiple fast iterations based on user feedback. Rapid prototyping is not for the refinement of ideas, but for the early weeding-out of bad ideas and identification of good ideas. The model for Rapid Prototyping — design/test/refine/repeat — is meant to embed user feedback throughout the design process and continuously align the product definition with the user’s point of view. Paper Prototyping is one possible route to rapid prototyping. </p>
