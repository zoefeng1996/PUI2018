		<h1>Think-Aloud Testing</h1>
		<p>Think-Aloud testing, or lab usability testing using the think-aloud protocol, is a common technique for testing an interface with a user. During a lab test, a researcher will directly observe while they try to accomplish a task. As the user completes this task, they are asked to think out loud, describing their expectations and feelings about the experience. Thinking out loud is a request made to users in many Practical UX Methods’ articles. Users’ words are important sources of insight and empathy for designers and are persuasive evidence of usability issues and user preferences when presenting to stakeholders. </p>
