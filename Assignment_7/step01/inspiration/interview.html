		<h1>Contextual Inquiry</h1>
		<p> A Contextual Inquiry is a user interview and observation session conducted wherever a prospective customer will use your product (for example, in their home or office). This allows for more realistic and honest insights than those that might be obtained during an interview in an unfamiliar location such as your usability lab or office, and allows you to observe them engaging in real-world use of the tools and products they use. Consider using this method if you have attempted to set up normal interviewers but subjects frequently complain that they are too busy; this method allows you to interview them while they work. </p>
