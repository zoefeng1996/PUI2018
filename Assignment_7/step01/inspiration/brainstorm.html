		<h1>Brainstorming</h1>
		<p> Brainstorming is a concept that most people learn in school at an early age, as it has been the go-to method for idea generation since the 1950s. The collective process of generating constraint-free ideas that respond to a given creative brief. Allows the team to visualize a broad range of design solutions before deciding which one to stick with. The goal is for a group to generate as many ideas as possible without passing any judgment. Ideas are refined and built upon as the session goes on. With no fear of judgment, participants feel comfortable sharing more unusual ideas. </p>
