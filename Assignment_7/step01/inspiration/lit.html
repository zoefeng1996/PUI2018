		<h1>Literature Review</h1>
		<p> A Literature Review is the mindful attempt by user experience designers to understand the current thinking of the business, its future plans, and the state of the marketplace. This is done by requesting pertinent internal business documents, reviewing industry publications, and searching the web for third party opinions, news, observations and analysis. The request for internal documents should be made at the Stakeholder Kickoff meeting. Because obtaining these documents — product roadmaps, marketing plans, market research, customer surveys, technology diagrams — is so important to understanding the business context, gaining agreement to provide internal documents should be an agenda item. </p>
